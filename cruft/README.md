# Cruft / Historical Documents

This directory contains historical analysis reports, test results, and optimization plans that are no longer part of the main documentation but preserved for reference.

**Current documentation is in the main README.md**

## Files in this directory:

- Various optimization reports from development iterations
- Historical test results
- Planning documents for specific optimization approaches
- Size comparison reports from different stages

These files are kept for historical context but are superseded by the information in the main README.md.
